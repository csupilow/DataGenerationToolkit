This project aims to create a toolkit consisting of tools and documentation for generating test data sets based on admin-selected criteria.

### Project Name

Data Generation Toolkit

Major use cases for these data sets include:

- QA an org populated with permutations of all, or nearly all, the types of data that are relavent to the project
- Be able to reliably and easily load sample data into a given Salesforce org (Production, Sandbox or scratch org)
- Have a data set for demos, potentially with the ability to add specific sets of data that could be used for story based training materials
- Have a data set that ensures the privacy of people represented in the dataset (i.e. not real names)
- Have data sets at scales that allow for testing bulk data processing

### Project Vision/Goals

- Everyone has access to an open process/tool to reliably generate sample data for telling user stories
- Design an admin-friendly interface to define requirements for data generation
- Data sets generated through this process could be appopriate for medium-sized orgs and can fit in a sandbox
- Data sets generated through this process could be valid for large data valume (LDV) testing
- Develop a process for how to build test data sets that follow a story 
- Prioritize leadership development/capacity building through project leadership/contributions from customers, partners, devs, etc.

### Ongoing Projects

Currently the project team has two major efforts for our work:

- Documentation of existing tools and partial solutions
- Creation of a community supported tool that will empower easy creation of data sets tailored to an org's needs

## Project Vertical

_Everyone._

This project is aimed at helping ease the process of generating test data for projects. Nearly all Salesforce projects benefit from improving this process.

### Project Team Accomplishments

- [October 2020-January 2021]
  - Continued work to refine and finalize documentation drafted in the September Virtual Sprint
  - Recruited support from the Salesforce.org Docs Team to review and suggest revisions to documentation
  - Presented CCI and Snowfakery use cases during the Contributor Technical Training & Collaboration Day hosted by Salesforce.org Open Source Commons on January 15th, 2021
- [9/23-9/24 Virtual Sprint]
  - Drafted architecture diagrams for a UI to sit on top of Snowfakery. This will be called _Snowmakery!_ There are two proof of concepts that have been initiated. One is inside of the org, the other is in Heroku.
  - Analyzed survey data from 75 community members; updated relevant Personas based on survey insights
  - Established document outline and Admin Story for documentation project that describes how to Generate Data and Move Data between orgs
  - Documented limitations and considerations for Partial Data sampling algorithm and manual steps, third party apps, and code for creating mock data records
  - Documented steps for an Admin-audience to use CCI to move data records from one Dev Sandbox to another Dev Sandbox (or any two persistent orgs)
  - QA-ed documentation steps for CCI steps (referenced above)
- [April 2020-September 2020]
  - Drafted personas for anticipated users of toolkit: Developer, Consultant, Senior Admin and Junior Admin
  - Developed and admistered survey to community members in order to gather insight on typical users and use cases
- [3/31-4/1 Virtual Sprint]
  - Determined that Snowfakery accomplishes many of the original requirements brainstormed at the Philly Sprint (fall 2019) (namely: ability to generate mock data with related tables, random names and values, standard and custom objects, datasets of any size/scale, ability to populate Salesforce orgs)
  - Socialized Snowfakery to community members
  - Onboarded project leadership from multiple orgs and began application for inclusion in Open Source Commons program
  - Refined use cases and differentiated Snowfakery from (1) existing tools in the market (2) proprietary tools at Salesforce (3) Full Sandbox product
  - Brainstormed 2+ potential directions for extending Snowfakery to include an admin-friendly web interface
  - Reviewed documentation and install steps
  - Overhauled ReadMe file

#### Proof of Concept Code

During the course of this project some ideas have been tested in code, and to ensure that code isn't lost and doesn't confuse other efforts in this repo they are kept in the proofs-of-concept directory.

Currently those include:

1. [A CumulusCI Task](proofs-of-concept/OriginalCciTask) that was created during this project's first sprint to generate permutations of data.
2. [A web-based Snowfakery recipe editor](proofs-of-concept/SnowmakeryEditory) that was created during the fall 2020 virtual sprint. This was the second tool named "Snowmakery" and largely confirmed that this project's UI will bare that name.
